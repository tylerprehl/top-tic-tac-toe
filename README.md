The overarching goal of this project are to demonstrate and help reinforce understanding and use of JavaScript objects (more specifically, factory functions and the module pattern)

11/7/23 - placed on hold in favor of learning more content instead of practicing old skills. There will be more projects to show off my skills in future lessons

### Complete so far:
<ul>
<li>Game/Player structure is built
<li>Start New Game function starts a new game with default or provided player names
<li>Players mark the board by clicking on the board cells
<li>Cells cannot be overwritten (was previously an issue)
</ul>

### Next on the To Do List:
<ul>
<li>Determine winner logic
<li>Track player wins
<li>Denote which player is which marker
<li>Allow players to switch markers (without resetting score)
<li>Cooler (properly sized) markers
</ul>

### Other interesting things of note:
<ul>
<li>Using events and their properties on event listeners
<li>Learned about linters (ESLint) and Prettier, and included in the project
</ul>
